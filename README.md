# Quasar-Classification-1

This study utilizes data obtained from the 13th edition of the Véron-Cetty and Véron Catalog of Active Galactic Nuclei and Quasars [7]. The complete dataset comprises 168,940 objects characterized across 13 distinct parameters, including 133,336 confirmed quasars, 1,374 BL Lacertae objects, and 34,231 active galaxies (of which 15,627 are classified as Seyfert 1 galaxies). The catalog provides comprehensive astrophysical measurements for each object, including:*

Celestial coordinates (right ascension and declination)

Redshift measurements

Photometric data in the U, B, and V bands

Radio flux densities at 6 cm and 20 cm wavelengths

*The complete catalog is publicly available through NASA's HEASARC archive (Véron-Cetty & Véron 2006, HEASARC Browse Interface, accessed 20 January 2023).
